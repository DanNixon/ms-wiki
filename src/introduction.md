# Introduction

Welcome to the [Maker Space](https://www.makerspace.org.uk/) wiki!

Here you will find (hopefully) all the information you could possibly want to know about our hackspace, how it works, what facilities we have and how to use them.

## In progress

This wiki is still being populated.
For now you may still need to head to [the old wiki](https://makerspace.pbworks.com) for some information.
